# twistednode
Twistednode is an ever evolving nodejs and express based http app engine.

There are other packages available to do what I am doing here but I know
my specific needs so decided to go this route and just use and write what I need.

Over time this will grow to add new features while also trying to keep it open
and explain what I am doing as I go.

Using this is not too difficult

If you download the repo it should contain all of the files needed to start this right up.


Checkout twistednode wherever you store your sites

git checkout https://github.com/cbryanvest/twistednode.git

Modify the port that twistednode.js will listen on by editing twistednode.js and changing this line

server_port = '4444'

to whatever port you want to use.

Run the server with 

node twistednode.js 

or your favorite package manager.
